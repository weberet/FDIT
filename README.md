# FDIT
Family Dog Information Tracker


My capstone project is titled “FDIT,” an abbreviated form of its full name of “Family Dog Information Tracker.” The objective of my capstone project was to build a closed system for a family to be able to track their newly adopted pets activities and as a result grow more accustomed to the needs and habits of their pets quickly and with less wasted communication of asking each member of the family when the dog was last fed, watered, walked, etc.

FDIT is a system containing two key components; The first of these components is the central dashboard device, in this case a Raspberry Pi with a touch capable TFT LCD screen. This device runs a python based software under the same name of "FDIT" which allows you to record the latest happenings of your pet at the press of a button. When these buttons, each containing an action, are pressed it logs those events to a database of events with accompanying information such as date and timestamp to enable any member of the family to quickly glance at the device and see the pets most recent activity. This database is then placed in a externally accessible directory on the Raspberry Pi's Linux filesystem where it can then be accessed by the companion app which was designed specifically for this project: <a href="https://github.com/weberet/SQlio">SQLio,</a> with the purpose of family members being able to check their pets activity not only from the central dashboard device, but also from their phones.
